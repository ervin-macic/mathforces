A windmill is a process that starts with a line $\\ell$ going through a single point $P \\in \\mathcal S$. The line rotates clockwise about the pivot $P$ until the first time that the line meets some other point belonging to $\\mathcal S$. This point, $Q$, takes over as the new pivot, and the line now rotates clockwise about $Q$, until it next meets a point of $\\mathcal S$. This process continues indefinitely.Show that we can choose a point $P$ in $\\mathcal S$ and a line $\\ell$ going through $P$ such that the resulting windmill uses each point of $\\mathcal S$ as a pivot infinitely many times.","Let $X,Y$ be two points on the side $BC$ of triangle $ABC$ such that $2XY=BC$ ($X$ is between $B,Y$). Let $AA'$ be the diameter of the circumcirle of triangle $AXY$. Let $P$ be the point where $AX$ meets the perpendicular from $B$ to $BC$, and $Q$ be the point where $AY$ meets the perpendicular from $C$ to $BC$. Prove that the tangent line from $A'$ to the circumcircle of $AXY$ passes through the circumcenter of triangle $APQ$.","On sides $AB$ and $BC$ of a non-isosceles triangle $ABC$ are selected points $C_1$ and $A_1$ such that the quadrilateral $AC_1A_1C$ is cyclic. Lines $CC_1$ and $AA_1$ intersect at point $P$. Line $BP$ intersects the circumscribed circle of triangle $ABC$ at the point $Q$. Prove that the lines $QC_1$ and $CM$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $A_1C_1$, intersect at the circumscribed circles of triangle $ABC$.","A convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ satisfies $AB\\cdot CD = BC\\cdot DA$. Point $X$ lies inside $ABCD$ so that\\[\\angle{XAB} = \\angle{XCD}\\quad\\,\\,\\text{and}\\quad\\,\\,\\angle{XBC} = \\angle{XDA}.\\]Prove that $\\angle{BXA} + \\angle{DXC} = 180^\\circ$.","Let $I$ be the incentre of acute triangle $ABC$ with $AB\\neq AC$. The incircle $\\omega$ of $ABC$ is tangent to sides $BC, CA$, and $AB$ at $D, E,$ and $F$, respectively. The line through $D$ perpendicular to $EF$ meets $\\omega$ at $R$. Line $AR$ meets $\\omega$ again at $P$. The circumcircles of triangle $PCE$ and $PBF$ meet again at $Q$. Prove that lines $DI$ and $PQ$ meet on the line through $A$ perpendicular to $AI$."];
