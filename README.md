**Mathforces is an intelligent IMO-level math practice website aimed at students without access to olympiad coaches**.

It uses a database of olympiad questions with difficulty spanning easy, medium, hard IMO problems, taken from the Art of Problem Solving website.
For each question, **Gemini 2.5** generates a series of 3 progressive hints that can guides the user to a full solution. 
In addition to Unlimited practice mode, the platform also has a competition mode with a format akin to the real IMO.
It also implements a feedback system for determining the average difficulty of each question.
